What's new in version 1.1
===========================
- There will be only one executable for all servers. 
- I have Added an optional variable in static_deploy.properties to show server type & server name in the Title bar:
	server_type=Internet

  Please note that if server_type is defined in static_deploy.properties then Title Bar will show 
  the serevr type plus the server name where Application is running otherwise Title will show only the server name.

- In static_deploy.properties, please keep the temp folder name without any path (to keep it local), to avoid any access issue.
	
	temp_folder=temp

  this temporary folder will be empty all the time and it is used and then cleaned  during the application deployment process.
  

- Log file improved with some additional details.
